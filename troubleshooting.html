			<p>The Australian National University (ANU) has released this script as a service to the broader community, as is, and with no guarantees of support. Hopefully this website and the following information is of assistance however. If you still require support, try the options listed under <a href="#support">Support</a>.</p>

				<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
				<h4>Things to try</h4>
				<p><strong>Try running <code>munkiimport</code> manually</strong><br>
				If you can't import items with <code>munkiimport</code>, <code>autoMunkiImporter.pl</code> will fail. The most likely problems are that the repo isn't mounted and / or your user doesn't have permissions to write to the repo.</p>
	
				<p><strong>Try a verbose run</strong><br>
				Try running <code>autoMunkiImporter.pl --verbose --data /path/to/individual/data.plist</code>. This will show more information that may help in tracking down the problem.</p>
	
				<p><strong>Look at the log file</strong><br>
				Open the log file in your favourite text editor. There maybe some useful information in it. The default location for the logs are <code>/Library/&#8203;Logs/&#8203;autoMunkiImporter</code>. The log location can be overridden by the data plist however.</p>
							
				<h4>Curl</h4>
				<p><code>curl</code> is used to access the web pages, handle redirects, and finally check if the application should be downloaded, and if so to download the application. You will occasionally get different results from curl then from Safari, so testing curl manually may be helpful.</p>
				<p>The best strategy is to use <code>curl --head --location http://www.example.com/path/to/url.ext</code> and review its content. Sites like Google Code block retrieving headers which is required for this script to work. In this case one of the returned headers will be <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code>.</p>
				<p>Also try using different (or no) User Agent (<code>curl --user-agent "my agent"</code>).</p>

				<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

				<p><strong>I could use this to automatically deploy updates via Munki couldn't I?</strong><br>
				Yes... <strong>BUT</strong> you shouldn't use it for that purpose. If you want to automatically deploy software you are not running a managed environment, and in that case you should let the applications run their own self updaters, or users install updates themselves.</p>
				<p>Auto Munki Importer can get major version changes which could have a material impact on your business. Each new application update should be tested and approved before being released to your production clients.</p>
				<p>I would only suggest automatically deploying to machines used by the systems administrator(s) for internal testing.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Auto Munki Importer downloaded previous version fine, but it hasn't downloaded the latest version...</strong><br>
				As the tool is monitoring websites that we have no control over, a change in the website can stop the script from running. There is no guarantee that Auto Munki Importer will continue to work for a site it's previously worked on. You may need to update the data plist, or try a different type depending on the changes.</p>

				<p><strong>Can I trust Auto Munki Importer to always download the latest version?</strong><br>
				<strong>No!</strong> As Auto Munki Importer monitors websites that are outside of our control there is no guarantee that it will always work. You should from time to time review all of your monitored apps and ensure that you have downloaded the latest version. The status plist at <code>/Library/&#8203;Logs/&#8203;autoMunkiImporter/&#8203;autoMunkiImporterStatus.plist</code> is a good place to start as it lists the download history of every application that's being monitored.</p>

				<p><strong>Can Auto Munki Importer handle "delta" updates (e.g. Adobe Creative Suite or Microsoft Office updates)?</strong><br>
				No. It's designed for complete applications that could be deployed independently of any other requirements.</p> 

				<p><strong>I want to make some changes to Auto Munki Importer. Will you accept the changes?</strong><br>
				If you would like to see changes you make merged into the Auto Munki Importer codebase, please make a pull request in Github. The changes will be assessed and considered for inclusion. 
				</p>

				<p><strong>I wish Auto Munki Importer could do "x". Will you add it?</strong><br>
				Please log feature requests via the <a href="https://github.com/neographophobic/autoMunkiImporter/issues">Auto Munki Importer Issue Tracker</a>, however I can offer no guarantees that they will be actioned. Auto Munki Importer is however open source, so you can view the latest version of the source code at <a href="https://github.com/neographophobic/autoMunkiImporter">https://github.com/neographophobic/autoMunkiImporter</a> and possibly make the changes yourself.
